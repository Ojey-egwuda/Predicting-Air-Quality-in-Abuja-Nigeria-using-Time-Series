# Predicting-Air-Quality-in-Abuja-Nigeria-using-Time-Series

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) in Abuja, Nigeria, to better understand the dynamics of air quality and potentially inform decision-making for improving public health.  Time series analysis techniques are employed to model PM2.5 trends and identify potential seasonal patterns.
